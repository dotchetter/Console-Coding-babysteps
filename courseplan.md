## It begins with the console

	In this our very first session we need to first go over some fundamentals before
	we get to writing some code. A programmer benefits tremendously from having some
	prerequisite knowledge of how the console in a computer works, and being able to
	navigate, copy, move and change files or directories(read:folders) from a
	command line shell. This will make troubleshooting simple programs and testing
	our code much more intuitive. You'll also become less fearful of the scary black
	window and feel more confident using a computer. You might even enjoy the console
	over the GUI if you're like me! 

	* CLI & GUI - What does it mean?
	* navigate in the console (cd, ls, tree)
	* start programs from the console
	* stop programs and processes from the console
	* environment variables
	* create, rename, move and delete files
	* write data to files

	# Assignments:

	* Create a folder with any name on your desktop
	* write your computer username in the contents of the file.
	* append your file with any sentence.
	* remove the folder with the file inside.

	Need help? Type "man" OR "help" "<command>" for assistance in how to type your 
	command. For example: 'man ls', 'man rm', 'help cd'

## Session 1: Intro to programming
	
	In this session we'll cover the very start and initial basics of why we program
	computers the way we do, how it is done and what happens behind the scenes in a
	short format. We will cover some concepts and terms in programming, including but
	not exclusive to: 

	* Quick dive in binary numbers, what they mean and how to read them
	* What is a variable? 
		- '=' vs '=='
		- input()
		- string concatenation
		- type(foo)

	* datatypes
		- str
		- int
		- float

	# Assignments:

	DEMO: Write a program that asks for your name and prints it out to the screen with a greeting.
	DEMO: Write a program that concatenates your first and last name with a provided email domain.

	Assignments:
	Replicate from DEMO.


## Session 2: logic control flow

	* logical operators
		- logical operators:
		and, or, not, xor, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, %
	
	* if, elif, else
		- if 1 == 0 (do something)
		- if foo == bar or foo == foofoo
		- if foo != bar and bar != 0
		- if foo >= bar or bar >= x


	# Assignments:
	
	DEMO: Write a program that tells you whether or not a given number is even
	DEMO: Write a number guessing game program

	Assignments:
	Replicate from DEMO but modify the even number program to give you only odd numbers


## Session 3: loops

	* loops
		- for loops
		- while loops

	
	# Assignments:
	
	DEMO: Write a program that can count to 100 and print to a box-like format.
	DEMO: Write a program that can print seconds like a clock for x seconds.
	
	Write a program that tells you if a number is a prime number or not, using for loops and modulo.


## Session 4:
